# SmoothMinecarts
This is basically that:
[Spigot Resource Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/traincarts.39592/) | [Dev Builds](https://ci.mg-dev.eu/job/TrainCarts/) | [Javadocs](https://ci.mg-dev.eu/javadocs/TrainCarts/)

BUT it will be cleaned up (at some point)

This Minecraft Bukkit server plugin aims to only implement the server-client communication that TrainCarts has.
Only tested for 1.16.4+
Requires [BKCommonLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bkcommonlib.39590/)

This plugin smooths out Minecart movement, especially noticeable with uCars (but only the experimental builds).
You can find experimental uCars-Builds for uCars v1.11+ here: [uCars](https://github.com/Jakllp/ucars/releases)
